DayZ Lingor by Skaronator.com
==========

Introdution
==========
We present you our new DayZ Lingor Island version for the great tropical map created by IceBreakr (IceBreakr.info). 
This version was made to solve some annoying problems on already existing versions of DayZ Lingor and to add some
new features in the future. Firstly it was just made for our own server and our own community, but we quickly decided to 
release it for everyone else to make it more popular and to give you all the chance to use a alternative version.



Description
==========
You may ask now what the difference between this version and already existing versions for DayZ Lingor is. Well, the way 
it works is pretty much the same, it is still DayZ for Lingor Island. We just fixed some major bugs and problems so far and 
added some stuff. But we are just at the beginning and we are already working on new features like a improved humanity system. 
It is really important for us, to get feedback from the community and users of our version to improve this project. 
Suggestions and your opinions about the project and our plans are always welcome.



Support
==========
			* 100% public
			* everyone (regardless of their chosen hoster or server setup) will be able to run their own DayZ Lingor Server
